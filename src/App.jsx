        <h3 className=""><span className="phase">Introduction:</span> The Soundtrack of Becoming</h3>
        <p>
          Music has always been more than entertainment to me — it's been a mirror, a map, a mentor. What began as casual listening to mainstream rock slowly evolved into something far more profound: a life spent discovering metal, one layer at a time. This isn’t a story of fandom. It’s a chronicle of transformation — from resistance to acceptance, from confusion to communion. And it all started with a band I never thought I’d like (And it always does).

        <h3 className=""><span className="phase">Phase One:</span> Entry Through the Gateway</h3>
        <p>
          My first steps into metal weren’t dramatic. They were familiar: <b>Bullet for My Valentine, Breaking Benjamin, Three Days Grace, More Than a Thousand</b> — examples of many bands with hooks, melody, and emotional accessibility. They were the bridges. Then came <b>Avenged Sevenfold</b>, the true turning point. Their earlier albums, infused with metalcore, death metal, and progressive tendencies, awakened something deeper. Complexity. Storytelling. Layers.

          From that point, it was no longer enough to just listen — <blockquote>"I wanted to feel, understand, and explore."</blockquote>

      <section className="">
        <h3 className=""><span className="phase">Phase Two:</span> The Symphony and the Spectacle</h3>
        <p>

          Next came the symphonic wave — <b>Nightwish, Epica, After Forever</b> — which expanded my sense of scale. Metal could be cinematic. Operatic. Emotional. I also dipped into visual kei with bands like <b>The Gazette</b> and <b>Dadaroma</b>, unlocking a theatrical and experimental side of metal I hadn’t known existed.

          Around this time, I started to test my boundaries. <p> I gave <b>Slipknot and System of a Down</b> another chance — bands I’d previously dismissed. But now, their chaos had meaning.  <blockquote>I was starting to develop what I now call "the ear" — the capacity to appreciate intensity as beauty.</blockquote>

        <h3 className=""><span className="phase">Phase Three:</span> The Progressive Awakening</h3>
        <p>

          Then came <b>Opeth</b>. At first, I avoided their harsh vocals as much as possible, clinging to their mid-era cleaner material. But soon, I discovered the heart of progressive metal: <b>Dream Theater, Tool, Pain of Salvation</b>. I wasn’t just listening anymore — I was experiencing. These bands were sonic novels, and I was all in.

          <p> And somewhere in this sonic maze, I circled back to bands like <b>Moonspell</b>. Ones I had shelved years earlier, now blossoming under my matured perception. I realized this wasn’t about taste. It was about readiness, and maturity.</p>

          <blockquote>“It’s not about taste —  it’s about readiness.”</blockquote>

      <section className="">
        <h3 className=""><span className="phase">Phase Four:</span> The Power Surge and the Folk Awakening</h3>
        <p>

          In between my exploration of <b>prog</b> and <b>melodeath</b>, a new force emerged: <b>Power Metal</b>. I attended a live <b>Sabaton</b> show, and that experience changed everything. Suddenly, power metal clicked. On Spotify, it might lack dynamics or technicality — but live, it explodes with adrenaline and unity.

          That show taught me something:

          <blockquote>"Metal isn't always about complexity — it's about states."</blockquote>

          I could lose myself in a chaotic and melancholic <b>Dir En Grey</b> performance, silent and absorbed for two straight hours, or I could be shouting with the crowd, holding my new sweaty best friends, while literally rowing in a mosh pit as if we’re crashing down against the waves in the Discovery Age - during a power metal set. This realization opened new doors: <strong>folk metal, folk-prog, and viking metal — bands like Verikalpa, Korpiklaani, Eluveitie, Dalriada, Ensiferum.</strong>
          <p>Shortly after, I found myself drawn to <b>djent</b>, and eventually into <b>math-rock</b>, both natural progressions from my love of progressive complexity.</p>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="">
        <h3 className=""><span className="phase">Phase Five:</span> Into Death, Through Melody</h3>
        <p>

          Next stop: <b>death metal</b> — more specifically, <b>melodic death metal</b>. Bands like <strong>Amon Amarth</strong> and <strong>Kataklysm</strong> were gateways, but it was <b>Be’lakor</b> that stole my soul. Their blend of melody and progressive depth felt like a culmination of everything I had loved before in music. Their lyrics are pure literature — unmatched in tone, imagery, and structure. The storytelling is incredible, immersive, and emotional, like reading ancient epics through modern sonic craft.

          This phase exploded into dozens of bands and over a hundred discographies — <b>Kalmah, Dark Tranquillity, In Mourning, Wintersun</b>, and many more. <p>I had finally arrived in the heart of the genre. And I thought to myself: <blockquote>  "This is it, I don’t think I can go any deeper than this."</blockquote></p>

        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="">
        <h3 className=""><span className="phase">Phase Six:</span> Beyond the Veil — Avant-Garde and the Abyss</h3>
        <p>
          With <b>Diablo Swing Orchestra</b>, the last barrier fell. Metal could be chaotic, theatrical, absurd — and still profound. I plunged into <b>Ne Obliviscaris</b>(extreme prog death), <b>Dir En Grey</b> (avant-gard prog death – at core), and started appreciating avant-garde, technical, and experimental forms that once seemed alien to me.
        </p>
        <p>But there was still one wall left: <strong className="bm">BLACK METAL.</strong></p>
        <p>I tried for years... I really did! <strong>Dimmu Borgir, Darkthrone, Burzum, Belphegor, Emperor</strong> — but nothing clicked. Not until I discovered <em>blackened death metal</em> through <b>Kanonenfieber</b>. That was the key. From there, the gates opened: <p><strong>  Grima, Gaerea, Arkona (late), Mgla, Imperial Triumphant, Sylvaine</strong>, and even fake and real <strong>Batushka-Patriarkh </strong> made sense.</p>

        </p>
        <p>
          I realized what I hadn’t seen before: the power of <strong>black metal</strong> lies not only in its abrasiveness and agression, it was not just nihilistic darkness or elitism. It's not just about anti-christ movements and Satan adoration.  There is something in its atmospheric, emotional, and even ritualistic qualities. It can be mystical, spiritual, transcendent and deeply enveloping — like a cold, timeless wind howling through forgotten temples.
        </p>

        <p>
          I learned something crucial: <blockquote>“it’s not about liking a genre — it’s about finding your way into it.”</blockquote>

        <h3 className=""><span className="phase">Phase Seven:</span> The Industrial Revelation</h3>
        <p>
          Ironically, one of my more recent breakthroughs came via a small live show. First through the band <b>Yokovich</b>, and later with <b>Killus</b> — two smaller acts that showed me the true soul of metal doesn't dwell on the grand, polished stages built for the casual, consumer-friendly crowd. It lives in the intimate venues, where musicians pour every part of themselves into the performance, becoming one with the sound. The genre: <b>industrial metal</b>, which I had never truly connected with before. But standing there, feeling the pulse of machines and menace, I finally understood — <blockquote> this wasn’t about complexity or reflection. It was about raw, cold, pulsing energy.</blockquote> A new facet of the metal multiverse had revealed itself to me.

        <h3 className=""><span className="phase">Phase Eight:</span> The Present Chapter</h3>
        <p>

          Right now, I'm still journeying — still discovering. This month alone, I’ve found myself immersed in a handful of incredibly diverse and genre-bending acts:
        </p><ul>
          <li className="phase-eight-li"> <b className="phase-eight-bands">Grima</b> — Atmospheric Black Metal/Ritualistic Black Metal that envelopes you in nature and solitude.</li>
          <li className="phase-eight-li"> <b className="phase-eight-bands">Sleep Token</b> — A fusion of Post-Djent / Ambient Progressive Metal laced with Alternative R&B, pop, and post-rock. Ethereal, heavy, and uniquely emotive.</li>
          <li className="phase-eight-li"> <b className="phase-eight-bands">Iotunn</b> — Progressive Melodic Death Metal with strong elements of Post-Black Metal, cosmic atmosphere, and light technicality — all carried by a vocalist who sounds like a power metal herald.</li>
          <li className="phase-eight-li"> <b className="phase-eight-bands">Myrkur</b> — A stunning blend of Black and Nordic Folk, weaving traditional Scandinavian instruments and ghostly melodies into her sound.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>  And that’s just this month. Who knows — maybe next month I’ll be diving into the great The <b>Dave Brubeck Quartet</b>  or <b>Fela Kuti</b>. That’s the fun of it: metal taught me how to listen — and now, I can listen to anything with open ears and an inquisitive mind.</p>

      <section className="">
        <h3 className=""><span className="phase">Conclusion:</span> There Is No End</h3>
        <p>
          This journey has taken almost two decades. From <b>pop</b> and mainstream <b>rock</b> CDs to exploring post-black, folk-black, symphonic death, oriental metal, doom, and beyond beyond beyond. Metal has become not just a genre, but a <b>landscape</b> — one that demands growth, patience, and open ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          What makes metal so eternal is that every subgenre brings its own emotional vocabulary:
        </p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Some make you feel introspective and reflective.</li>
        <li>Others pull you into trance-like immersion.</li>
        <li>Some blast you with rage, while others uplift with beauty or euphoria.</li>
        <p><i>Some people don’t listen to metal because they say they “don’t like it.” But I believe it’s often because they haven’t yet learned how to listen to it. I always tell my friends: <blockquote>you have to develop the ear. You don’t just hear metal. You become it.</blockquote></i></p>

        <p>And then there are those who listen to metal, but never go beyond the surface. They find a comfort zone — maybe a few favorite bands or one subgenre — and stay there. And while there’s nothing wrong with loving what speaks to you, I can’t help but feel they’re missing out on the vastness that metal offers. The depth. The diversity. The transformation. <b>Because metal isn't just a sound — it's a spectrum.</b> And staying in one corner of it is like staring at a single star in a night sky full of galaxies, just because the others are currently blinding. What they may not realize is that the blinding becomes beauty — once you’ve matured enough to see it. </p>
        <p className="evolution">Metal doesn’t just ask for your attention; it asks for your evolution.</p>
      </section>

      <section className="final">
        <h3 className="">You’re still here?</h3>
        <p>
          And still, I’ve only told part of the story. There are entire subgenres I haven’t even touched — waves upon waves of evolving sound, and new branches growing every year like veins through stone. That’s the wonder of metal: it doesn’t stand still. While other genres lean on their past, <b>metal is always in motion</b> — transforming, mutating, shedding its skin to become something new. Of all musical forms, it is the one that has aged with the most grace — not by staying the same, but by daring to change. It reinvents itself more fiercely than jazz, more freely than rock, more fearlessly than pop. It doesn’t just survive time — it devours it, and becomes it.
